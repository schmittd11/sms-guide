# Bianco 7
Bianco 7 is a Shadow Mario (SM) Shine. You should be comfortable with hoverslides and spam sprays to have success with this shine.
### Beginner - No Quick Kill
- Hold up and hoverslide from the start
- Rollout and spray Shadow Mario with Analog R, chasing him if necessary
- Be sure to aim for the lower half of his body
- Once he's knocked down, hoverslide into him and collect the shine

### Advanced - Quick Kill
- Hold up and hoverslide from the start
- As you approach SM, dive hop or hold back to slow down
- Press Digital R and A on the same frame to spam spray while performing a dive recovery. This will direct a spam spray directly at SM
- If SM continues running, chase and spray him with Analog R
- Once he's knocked down, collect the shine
