# Bianco 5
Bianco 5 is made up of two parts: the Entry and the Petey Fight. You should be comfortable with hoverslides, (jump) dive rollouts, spin jumps, sideflips, and triple jumps to have success with this shine. The intermediate and advanced strats for this level require knowledge of glitchy wall kick dives (GWKDs) and insta-momentum spin jumps.
## Entry

### Beginner - Log Triple Jump
- From the start, hold up and hoverslide
- Aim for the middle of the log, buffer a hover as you slide off the path, release hover, then double jump off the log
- Triple jump and hover up to the while wall
- Dive rollout left along the wall twice, then spin jump and hover up to the higher section of the wall
- Buffer a hover over the gap in the wall, then spin jump and hover up to the green slope
- Spam spray and dive rollout twice to clear goop and get to the flat section of the grass
- Spam spray and dive into the water to waterslide, then rollout and allow a poink to attach to FLUDD
- Backflip and shoot the poink to hit Petey
