# Bianco 6
Bianco 6 is made up of two parts: the Entry and the Secret. The Secret is then broken up into the Lower and Upper sections. You should be comfortable with hoverslides, (jump) dive rollouts, spin jumps, sideflips, and triple jumps to have success with this shine. The intermediate and advanced strats for this level require knowledge of glitchy wall kick dives (GWKDs) and insta-momentum spin jumps.
## Entry
The entry is the same for every skill level, with the only major difference being whether you have enough speed to waterslide up the hill and over the bridge in a single slide or have to rollout and start a second slide over the bridge.
### One Slide
- From the start, hold up and hoverslide
- Aim for the middle of the log, buffer a hover as you slide off the path, release hover, then double jump off the log
- If your double jump doesn’t have enough speed to reach the doorway in the white wall, perform a short dive and rollout into the doorway.
- Hoverslide or jump dive through the doorway then rollout.
- Aiming just left of the sign with the arrow, jump and spam spray, then dive into the water and start a waterslide
- Waterslide up the hill and over the bridge in a continuous waterslide. If you don’t have enough speed, rollout and use the backup which is covered in the section below.
- After the bridge, rollout over the gap in the path, dive rollout towards the small grass hill, then jump between the green shrubs
- Hoverslide along the path, and fall off, aiming for the rightmost log
- Hover to the right log, dive onto it, then rollout onto the middle log
- Jump up to the cave entrance and dive to waterslide into the secret entrance

### One Slide Backup
- If you don’t have enough speed up the hill before the bridge, rollout as you begin losing speed.
- Jump, (spam) spray, then dive into the water and slide through the bridge.
- Note that the water must be on the white path before the bridge for the waterslide to work.

## Lower Secret
### Beginner
#### Second Momentum Spin
- Dive as Mario falls while entering the level
- Rollout, jump dive, dive hop long the first blue square, then rollout onto the second blue square
- Dive rollout onto the third blue square, then spin jump dive to the blue platform, making sure to avoid the star
- Dive hop again if necessary, then rollout to ledgegrab the cube.
- Center the camera with L and pull yourself up. Center Mario on the cube
- Wait for the second turn of the cube when it rotates backwards. Perform a short jump, then dive into the cube and perform an insta-momentum spin jump all the way to the yellow platform
- Dive rollout on the yellow platform, then dive rollout again onto the elevator cube
- Hold neutral on the stick and press B when Mario lands on the cube to make him grab the air. This immediately stops his momentum; the cube waits for Mario to be at a complete stop to begin traveling.

### Intermediate
#### Spin Jump Y-Turn
- Follow the beginner strat until Mario ledgegrabs the first cube, aiming to ledgegrab at the seam just left of the blue square. Press L to center the camera.
- Run forward, jump, then buffered spin jump off the edge of the cube.
- Wait briefly, then y-turn towards the yellow wall. Mario’s angle approaching the wall should be a little less than 45 degrees.
- Get out of y-cam before touching the wall. Wall kick and dive off the wall towards the yellow platform
- Rollout along the yellow platform, then dive rollout again onto the elevator cube. Hold neutral and press B to stop Mario’s momentum

### Advanced
#### Speedspin
- Follow the beginner strat until Mario ledgegrabs the first cube, aiming to ledgegrab the middle of the cube. Press L to center the camera
- Run to the left of the cube, then turn right to run towards the front corner of the cube as it makes its first turn
- Jump then dive into the cube and insta momentum spin all the way to the yellow platform
- Dive rollout on the yellow platform, then dive rollout again onto the elevator cube. Hold neutral and press B to stop Mario’s momentum

## Upper Secret
The strats that will be available to you at the upper portion of the secret will depend on how quickly you reached the elevator cube, and whether you decide to GWKD on the upper yellow platform.
### Beginner
#### Blue Cycle
- Spin jump straight up then dive onto the yellow platform
- Rollout then spin jump dive to the front, center blue square
- Perform a short rollout then spin jump dive to the back, center blue square
- Rollout onto the red square, then dive rollout onto the green platform
- Dive rollout, then jump dive into the shine

{% include yt.html id="hSI5Y4GvtzE" %}
### Intermediate
#### Left Side
- Spin jump straight up then dive onto the yellow platform
- Rollout then jump dive to the front, left red square
- Rollout onto the middle, left blue square, then spin jump dive to the back, center blue square
- Rollout onto the red square, then dive rollout onto the green platform. Jump dive into the shine

{% include yt.html id="za9mG8atowQ" %}
### Advanced
#### Red Cycle
- GWKD onto the yellow platform, rollout, then jump dive to the front, left red square
- Rollout to the center, middle red square
- Dive, then rollout to the back, center blue square
- Dive rollout of the blue square and onto the back, right red square
- Jump dive to the green platform, rollout, and jump dive into the shine
